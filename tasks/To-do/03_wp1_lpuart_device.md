- ~~FIFO implementation~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~RX functionality~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Interrupt handling~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Error handling~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Power management~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Multiple LPUART instances~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Baud rate calculation~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Advanced features (parity, stop bits, etc.)~~ (Phase 2)
