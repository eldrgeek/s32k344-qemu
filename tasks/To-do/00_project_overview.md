# S32K344 QEMU Project - Task Overview

## Project Summary
This project implements a complete QEMU machine model for the NXP S32K344 ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The implementation includes peripheral devices, firmware testing, and upstream integration.

## Getting Started
1. Begin with task file `01_setup_and_automation.md`
2. Follow TDD principles - write tests first
3. Use Playwright MCP for web automation tasks
4. Move completed tasks to `tasks/Review/` then `tasks/Done/`
5. Update checkboxes as: `[x] **Done** - [ ] **Reviewed**` and `[x] **Done** - [x] **Reviewed**`
