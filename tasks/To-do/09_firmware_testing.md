## ~~Deferred to Phase 2 (Windows Conversion)~~
- ~~Comprehensive Zephyr testing~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~CAN communication tests~~ (Phase 2)  
- ~~Timer and interrupt tests~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Power management tests~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Stress and endurance tests~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Multi-core testing~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Regression testing~~ (Phase 2)
- ~~Performance validation~~ (Phase 2)

## Success Definition
**Demo passes if**: Both Zephyr "Hello World" and "blinky" samples run successfully in QEMU S32K344 machine, demonstrating the complete LLM-driven development workflow from blank repository to working embedded system emulation.
